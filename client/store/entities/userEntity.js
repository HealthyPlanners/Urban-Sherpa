Create action is part of Reduxjs toolkit and will automatically create
a function that returns an object with a type property set to the argument
passed to createAction, and a payload property consistent with whatever
argument is passed to the created function.

function usersRequest(actionPayload) {
  return {
    type: 'usersRequestX',

/*
Create reducer is a redux toolkit function that maps function definitions
to action types and returns a single reducer for export.
Under the hood it uses a library called IMMER that will
allow us to right simpler code without having to worry about mutating state.
I believe it will also return state by default if no action types match.

/*
Most of the time we user action creators to return objects. We dispatch the
objects returned by action creators to our reducers to update state. Sometimes 
we want to execute logic though and we can't do that with simple action creators and
the objects they return. 
Redux Toolkit comes with a built in middleware called THUNK. THUNK allows us to 
pass functions as actions. Thunk will check the type of an action, if it is a function, 
thunk will CALL THAT FUNCTION. Below are action generators (I made up that term, it's not
real). These, when called will return functions that, when called, return a specific action
object. These action generators essentially return action creators, but allow us to pass
parameters to those action creators as payload. In this case, we can create one action
for an API call but customize the data and type based on what we give the action generator.
Confusing, but solid practice and implacations extend beyond fetch requests.
